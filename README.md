# Rishi
Greetings everyone! Welcome to my GitHub page. As obvious, this comes from the special repository. I'm just a guy trying to build experiences. I started GitHub only over this past summer, leveraging what I already know from classes partly, and in a way learning the rest on the spot. I've got a long mile to go, but I hope to create good experiences, and the best versions of them. Credit where due, AI helps!
